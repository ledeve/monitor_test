  <li>In Epoch 7, we hit a <b>record-high number of users participating in the allocation window</b> (659 vs. 496 in Epoch 6). On the flip side, only 26% of eligible users actually showed up — <b>the lowest relative turnout we've ever seen</b>. This drop is mostly due to the low participation of newly onboarded users from the SheFi and Celo communities (32% and 15% respectively), along with a substantial dip among Epoch 6 allocators.<a href="#epoch-turnout"> -> details</a></li>
  
  <li>Zooming out a bit: we have plenty of evidence that <b>the climate round just didn’t capture the community’s imagination like previous horizontal Web3/OSS/Ethereum rounds.</b> Some highlights:
    <ul class="nested-list">
      <li>A whopping 48% of users who allocated in Epoch 6 decided to <b>sit this one out entirely</b> (for context, this drop-off was at 22-35% in earlier epochs, exepct for Epoch 4 when sybils fled).<a href="#transitions-of-allocators"> -> details</a></li>
      <li><b>Total donations fell to their lowest level since we introduced PPF (4.53 ETH) </b>. The share of the budget allocated to projects dropped across all user-size categories — especially among whales and in the sub-500 GLM category (i.e., mostly users we brought in via marketing).<a href="#distribution-of-donations"> -> details</a></li>
      <li>A not-so-small group of users, especially those under 500 GLM, <b>chose to simply claim their full rewards without donating to any project</b>. This group rose from 3 users in Epoch 6 to 69 in Epoch 7. Overall, the share of donors (users who allocated anything to projects) dropped by more than 10 percentage points.<a href="#user-types"> -> details</a></li>

<li> Other interesting observations:
    <ul class="nested-list">
    <li><b>High turnout in the second week of AW </b>— something we hadn’t seen in earlier epochs.<a href="#epoch-progress"> -> details</a></li>
    <li><b>Frequency of changed allocation decisions is back to pre-QF levels.</b><a href="#allocation-changes"> -> details</a></li>
    <li><b>No obvious voter collusion</b>, except for a high high correlation between two projects (Atlantis and GainForest).<a href="#correlations-voters-agenda"> -> details</a></li>
