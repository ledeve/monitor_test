  <li>In Epoch 7 we've reached a <b>record-high number</b> of users participating in allocation window (659 vs 496 in Epoch 6). On the other hand, only 26% of eligible users participated, which is a record-low turnout in relative terms This is mainly due to the low participation of the newly-onboarded users from the SheFi and Celo commutnies (XX and, YY respectively) as well as a ZZ percentage participation drop in the group of Epoch 6 allocators.</li>
  
  <li>Zooming out, we have ample evidence to claim that the climate round was not as interesting and engaging for our existing community as earlier horizontal web3/OSS/Ethereum rounds. This is backed by the following total observations:
    <ul class="nested-list">
      <li>As much as XX users who made an allocation in Epoch 6, did not do allocation in Epoch 7 (on average this drop was at in earlier epochs).</li>
      <li>Total donations hit the lowest level since introduction of PPF (XX). The share of budget allocated to projects fell in comparison with Epoch 6 in all user-size categories, in particular among whales ( ) and in the sub-500 GLM category, i.e mostly users onboarded through our marketing campaigns.</li>
      <li>A pretty big group of users, especially in the sub-500 GLM category chose to claim the entire rewards without donating anything to potential beneficiaries. The size of this group rose from 3 users Epoch 6 to as many as 69 users in Epoch 7. The share of donors (i.e. users allocating anything to projects) fell by more than 10 percentage points.</li>
