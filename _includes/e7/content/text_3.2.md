This chart tracks the engagement of Octant users who made an allocation in a given epoch. On average, after one epoch, 92% of users still have their GLM locked, but only 66.9% participate in the next allocation window. After two epochs, 80.3% still have GLM locked, but participation drops to 52.6%. Fast-forward six epochs: only 56.9% still have any GLM locked, and just 21.0% show up for allocations.
Note: This is based on averages for each epoch (thin line charts). We have six observations for the first interval (1 epoch passed) and only one for the sixth interval.

The chart also highlights how unique Epoch 7 was for Epoch 6 allocators — 48% of them skipped the Epoch 7 allocation window, the biggest drop we've seen so far. We had a similar drop-off between Epochs 3 and 4, but that was mostly due to sybil addresses leaving after QF was introduced. This time, it’s more likely because of the climate-themed round not appealing to the broader user base.
