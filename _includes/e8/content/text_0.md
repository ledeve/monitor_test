  <li>Epoch 8 turnout <b>dropped sharply to 365 users</b> (-45% vs Epoch 7’s 659), with <b>only 28% of eligible accounts participating</b>. The decline stems mainly from lower engagement in the SheFi cohort, the absence of new onboarding campaigns and little organic growth. Of the 1,296 users with a non-zero budget, just 55% are currently active (28%) or potentially active (27%), i.e. having skipped only a single epoch.</li>

  <li>Encouragingly, a <b>meaningful slice of users who skipped Epoch 7 returned in Epoch 8</b>, hinting that <b>this round’s theme resonated better</b>. That insight is reinforced by a higher donor share across most user groups and a markedly better donation-to-budget ratio among larger lockers, whales included. Total donations climbed from 4.5 ETH in Epoch 7 to 14.1 ETH in Epoch 8.</li>

  <li>This time, <b>quadratic funding distribution of the MF quite sharply contrasted with the linear distribution</b> (which we used until Epoch 4). Ranking hinged on donor count rather than sheer volume, most notably for GrowThePie, which mobilised the largest pool of single-agenda contributors.</ul>.
